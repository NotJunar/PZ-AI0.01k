# PZ-AI0.01k: AI Language Model Experiments

Welcome to the PZ-AI0.01k repository! This project showcases various implementations of language models, from simple n-gram models to more advanced neural network-based approaches. Our crown jewel is the "Rizzline Generator," a fun and practical application of language modeling.

## 🚀 Projects

### 1. Simple Language Model
A basic implementation of an n-gram language model.

### 2. Advanced Language Model
An LSTM-based language model with improved text generation capabilities.

### 3. Transformer Language Model
A language model using the Transformer architecture, inspired by modern NLP techniques.

### 4. Rizzline Generator
Our star project! A language model trained to generate pickup lines (a.k.a. "rizzlines").

## 🛠️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/NotJunar/PZ-AI0.01k.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install torch numpy
   ```

## 💻 Usage

### Rizzline Generator

1. Prepare your training data in a file named `rizzlines.txt`, with one pickup line per line.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python practical-showcase.py
   ```
3. The model will train on your data and then allow you to generate new lines or complete partial lines interactively.

## 📊 Example Output

Here are some example rizzlines generated by our model:

1. Are you a magician? Because whenever I look at you, everyone else disappears.
2. Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I walk by again?
3. Is your name Wi-Fi? Because I'm really feeling a connection.
4. Can I be your personal trainer? I'd love to work you out.
5. Are you a parking ticket? Because you've got FINE written all over you.
